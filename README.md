# AP-Comp-Sci
Area to Sync code from APCS Class and home.

Hey!
I don't really know why you're reading this, unless what you like to do is surf GitHub for random public repositories and if that's the 
  case then I won't judge.
If you're wondering what this repository is, it's a way for me to sync my java files from my Ap Computer Science class at 
  school to my computer at home and vice-versa.
So, yeah, you're free to look around my code and stuff  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

P.S If you're in my class and somehow found this, please don't steal my code.
P.P.S If you're wondering why I didn't make a privet Repository, It's because I'm not going to spend money on crap like that.
